Todo List App - README
Vision
The Todo List App is designed to provide a simple, decentralized, and secure task management solution using blockchain technology. With an immutable and transparent task management system, users can create, update, and manage their personal or collaborative task lists efficiently. The contract ensures that each task is stored securely, with no possibility of tampering or loss, thus fostering accountability and reliability in task tracking.

Our vision is to deliver a streamlined, user-friendly platform where users can easily manage their to-do lists while ensuring the integrity and transparency of the system using blockchain technology.

Features
1. Create and Manage To-Do Lists
Create Task Lists: Each user can generate a new to-do list that is tied to their account. This list can hold an unlimited number of tasks, ensuring that all tasks for various projects are easily manageable.
2. Add Tasks
Add New Tasks: Users can add new tasks with a description (content) that they wish to complete. Each task starts as incomplete and can be updated later.
3. Mark Tasks as Completed
Complete a Task: Once a task is done, users can mark it as completed to signify its fulfillment. This updates the task status but keeps it stored in the list for future reference.
4. Remove Tasks
Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks from their list once they are no longer needed, keeping their to-do list organized and clutter-free.
5. Blockchain-Backed Security
The system leverages blockchainâ€™s decentralized nature to ensure that task lists cannot be altered or deleted without the owner's consent. This adds a level of security and transparency, ensuring tasks are safely stored and auditable.
6. User-Specific Task Lists
Each account has its own dedicated to-do list, ensuring personal task management while allowing complete user control over adding, completing, or removing tasks.
